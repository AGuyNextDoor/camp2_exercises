// > Frieda and Francis walk on the street. Frieda is 22 and Francis is 17.
//
// Create two objects, `francis`, `frieda` with the fields : `age` (an integer) and `name`, (obviously a string)


// Create two variables `canFriedaDrinkAlcohol` and `canFrancisDrinkAlcohol` to answer, respectively, to the question "Can he / she drink
// alcohol.".
// These variables should stay correct if we modify the ages of the objects `francis` and `frieda` in the declaration.

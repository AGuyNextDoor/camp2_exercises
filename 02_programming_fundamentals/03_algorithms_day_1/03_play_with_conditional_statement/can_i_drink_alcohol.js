// Create two objects, `man`, `woman` with the fields : `age` (an integer) and `name`, (obviously a string)


// create a variable `isFriedaAMan` with the answer to the question : "Is Frieda a man?"


// Create two variables `canFriedaDrinkAlcohol` and `canFrancisDrinkAlcohol` to answer, respectively, to the question "Can he / she drink
// alcohol.". These variables should stay correct if we modify the ages of the objects `man` and `woman`.
